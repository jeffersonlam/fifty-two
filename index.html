<h1>52</h1>
<h3>52 weeks, 52 projects</h3>
<p>You're looking at the initial draft of my page for my 52 weeks of code.</p>
<p>I don't know how it's going to look yet, but I'm gonna pretty it up somehow.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to give each project a section, with a link to the project and a blurb. It doesn't need to be anything complicated, it just needs to work well and be easy to navigate.</p>
